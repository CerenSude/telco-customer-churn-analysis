Telco Customer Churn Prediction (Work in Progress 🚧)

📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes the Telco Customer Churn dataset, with the goal of understanding customer behavior and building models to predict churn.

## 📂 Current Progress

✅ **Data loading & cleaning**  
✅ **Identification of categorical & numerical features**  
✅ **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
✅ **Data preprocessing** (encoding, scaling, handling missing values)  
✅ **Model building** (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, etc.)  
✅ **Model evaluation and comparison**

---

## ➡️ Next Step

➡️ Analyze **feature importance** for **Random Forest** and **Logistic Regression** models to interpret which variables most strongly influence customer churn.
