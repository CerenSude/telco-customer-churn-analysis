Telco Customer Churn Prediction (Work in Progress 🚧)

📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes the Telco Customer Churn dataset, with the goal of understanding customer behavior and building models to predict churn.

📂 Current Progress

✅ Data loading & cleaning
✅ Identification of categorical & numerical features
✅ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Distribution of churn vs non-churn customers

Boxplots and histograms for numerical features

Insights on service usage and churn relationship

✅ Data preprocessing (encoding, scaling, handling missing values)
✅ Model building (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, etc.)
✅ Model evaluation and comparison

🔜 Next Step

Feature importance analysis

🗂 Dataset

The dataset used is the Telco Customer Churn dataset, available on Kaggle
