Telco Customer Churn Prediction (Work in Progress 🚧)
📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes the Telco Customer Churn dataset, with the goal of understanding customer behavior and building models to predict churn.

At this stage, the focus is on Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify patterns, trends, and potential issues in the dataset. In the next steps, I will implement preprocessing, machine learning models, and evaluation.

📂 Current Progress

✅ Data loading & cleaning
✅ Identification of categorical & numerical features
✅ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Distribution of churn vs non-churn customers

Boxplots and histograms for numerical features

Insights on service usage and churn relationship

🔜 Next Steps

Data preprocessing (encoding, scaling, handling missing values)

Model building (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, etc.)

Model evaluation and comparison

Feature importance analysis

🗂 Dataset

The dataset used is the Telco Customer Churn dataset, available on Kaggle
